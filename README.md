OffensiveGolang is a collection of offensive Go packs inspired by different repositories. Ideas have been taken from <a href="https://github.com/bluesentinelsec/OffensiveGoLang">OffensiveGoLang</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RQb05ITSyk">Ben Kurtz's DEFCON 29 talk</a>.

This repository has some basic implementations and examples that depending on the environment in which they are used can be easily detected by defensive systems. The goal is to support the rapid development of red team tools by providing common functions and with the possibility of improvements by the community.
The different modules presented are the following:
</p>

The different modules presented are the following:

- **Encryption**: Module that allows encrypting the payload shellcode using AES and a 32-byte random key.
- **Evasion**: Based on other projects such as [robotgo](https://github.com/go-vgo/robotgo), functions have been implemented that identify screen dimensions, mouse movements and process information in order to avoid the execution of binaries in sandboxes.
- **Exfil**: Implements functions that allow loading the shellcode from an external web server or sending a screenshot after having used the screenshot method through a POST request.
- **Persistence**: Allows you to create a scheduled task using the methods provided by the [taskmaster](https://github.com/capnspacehook/taskmaster) project. In addition, you can also modify the Windows registry to run a binary at startup.
- **Payloads**: set of methods collected from different repositories that allow from generating a simple reverse shell in Golang to injecting code into the memory of an existing process.
- **Examples**: Different examples using the modules described above.
